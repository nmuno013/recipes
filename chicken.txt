Chicken and Cashews

Pair this entrée with a simple rice pilaf: Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1⁄2 cup chopped onion and 2 teaspoons grated peeled fresh ginger to pan; sauté 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup water, 1⁄2 cup long-grain rice, and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 12 minutes or until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat; stir in 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro.
